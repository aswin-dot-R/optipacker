# Distributors Pallet Optimization
![Figure Pallet](examples/inputs/figure_pallet_0.png)
The Distributors Pallet Optimization project aims to solve the three-dimensional pallet-packing problem faced by distributors. The project utilizes a Python implementation of a volume optimization solver to efficiently pack boxes onto pallets, minimizing wasted space and maximizing utilization.

## Features

- Random Generation of Test Cases: The system allows users to generate random test cases consisting of pallet dimensions and box sizes.
- Volume Optimization Solver: The system employs a volume optimization solver to determine the most efficient arrangement of boxes on pallets, considering their dimensions and available space.
- Visualization: The system provides visual representation of the packed pallets using 3D plots, showcasing the packed boxes and their orientations.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/distributors-pallet-optimization.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Generate test cases or provide your own input file.
4. Run the solver: `python palletier_example.py`
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to select the test case and view the optimized pallet packing solution.
